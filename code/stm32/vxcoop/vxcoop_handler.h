 * vxcoop_handler.h - VX-COOP: VXT toolkit reference application, STM32 side.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 * GPLv3.
 *
 * VX-COOP exercises every reusable component of the VXT cooperative dual-CPU
 * toolkit: SmartList drawing, the draw-scale ladder, 3D-to-2D projection,
 * backface culling, edge occlusion, three-channel-plus-noise sound with
 * conflict resolution, controller input, and per-unit calibration. It contains
 * no application content and depends on no application layer; a VX-COOP
 * firmware image links none.
 *
 * Build:   make vxcoop USE_HW=v0.3
 *          (equivalent to: make clean && make all VXT_ENABLE_GAME=0
 *           VXT_ENABLE_VXCOOP=1)
 * Cart:    code/app6809/VXCOOP/VXCOOP.asm -> VXCOOP.bin on the SD card
 * Reference guide: docs/VX-COOP/VX-COOP_Reference_Guide.md
 *
 * RPC 78 (per frame) and 79 (one-shot boot init). These are the last two free
 * identifiers in the toolkit-reserved 64-79 block; 64 and 65 are also free.
 * Note that main.c's dispatch hook routes only 64-79 to vxtRpcDispatch(), so
 * the 19-63 and 80+ application ranges described in vxt_rpc.h are unreachable
 * until that test is widened. See the reference guide's RPC chapter.
