 * VXT_SND_OFFSET ($2000), so ($2000-$0800)/4 = 1536 records fit. Exceeding it
 * causes the draw list to overwrite the sound block.
 *
 * VXC_RECORDS_50HZ is the TIMING bound, and is approximately one third of the
 * memory bound. The two processors are serialized, the 6809 draws at a
 * measured 32.6 to 46.6 cycles per record, and a 50Hz frame allows roughly 20ms
 * of 1.5MHz 6809 time. The product is 510 to 730 records actually drawable per
 * frame. A frame that fits in memory but not in time produces flicker rather
 * than an incorrect image.
 *
 * Every page displays its live record count, because the platform has no
 * simulator for 6809 draw timing and the budget must therefore be measured.

 * SECTION 2 - THE MESH: geometry, faces, and edge-to-face adjacency
 *
 * A cube is the appropriate mesh for demonstrating culling because it is CONVEX
 * and CLOSED, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for backface
 * culling to constitute exact hidden-line removal. On a non-convex model - a
 * panel mounted on a strut, a fin on a stalk - a face may be front-facing and
 * nevertheless occluded by another part of the same object, and no test on face
 * normals can detect that case.
 *
 * Each face carries a unit outward normal and d = dot(n, faceCentre), the
 * plane's geometric offset from the model origin. Store the raw d rather than a
 * threshold with the model scale already applied: the two are algebraically
 * equivalent, but a scale-baked threshold becomes silently invalid whenever a
 * scale constant is retuned.
 *
 * For this unit cube each face center lies one unit along its own normal, so
 * every d equals 1.0. That is a property of the cube and not a general result.
 *
 * A face normal must never be approximated as the direction from the model
 * centroid to the face. That approximation is valid only for a convex mesh
 * centered on its own origin. For a convex mesh no authored face list is
 * required at all: computing the exact convex hull of the vertex list yields
 * faces, outward normals and edge-to-face adjacency, and also serves as an
 * independent check on any face data supplied from elsewhere.

 * SECTION 3 - THE APERTURE: convex-polygon classification and per-edge clipping
 *
 * This is EDGE OCCLUSION: geometry visible only through an opening in the
 * foreground. It is distinct both from Section 2's backface culling, which
 * removes an object's own hidden half, and from shadow-volume occlusion, which
 * removes other geometry lying behind a solid.
 *
 * The procedure has two stages, because the inexpensive stage resolves most
 * frames:
 *   1. CLASSIFY the object's projected bounding circle against the aperture as
 *      INSIDE (draw unclipped, at no additional cost), CULL (emit nothing), or
 *      STRADDLE.
 *   2. For STRADDLE only, clip each edge individually.
 *
 * A STRADDLE classification does NOT imply that every edge crosses the
 * boundary. The classification tests a conservative bounding CIRCLE, so objects
 * are routinely classified STRADDLE with no edge actually crossing. Testing
 * each edge's own endpoints first, and paying the clipping cost only for edges
 * that genuinely cross, is therefore necessary; purchasing the expensive path
 * for an entire model in order to correct two edges is a common way to exceed
 * the record budget.

 * SECTION 4 - SOUND: a three-channel song, an effect, and their conflict
 *
 * The AY-3-8912 provides three independent monophonic tone oscillators, one
 * noise generator routable to any of them, and a SINGLE mixer register
 * governing all six routings. Two consequences follow.
 *
 * First, because the mixer is one register, a statement of the form "channel B
 * now requires noise" cannot be expressed independently; the entire byte is
 * rewritten. Two callers each writing an independent conception of the mixer is
 * the characteristic failure, and its symptom is an effect whose routing is
 * silently reverted by a later write within the same frame.
 *
 * Second, the AY's registers are latched: once programmed they generate and
 * sustain the sound, freeing the host processor. Only changes should therefore
 * be queued. A frame containing no sound change costs the 6809 approximately 12
 * cycles, because vxt_sound.asm compares a sequence byte and returns.
 * Re-emitting an unchanged tone each frame discards that property entirely.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PAGE DEMONSTRATES. The song occupies all three channels. The
 * explosion effect needs a channel for a noise burst, so it borrows one from
 * the song and returns it afterwards. That is the whole conflict, and it is the
 * conflict every application with music and effects has to resolve.
 *
 * THE RESOLUTION, in the order the frame performs it:
 *   1. vxtMusicUpdate() runs FIRST. The player performs one unconditional claim
 *      of the whole mixer register on its first call after vxtMusicPlay(), so an
 *      effect starting on that exact frame would otherwise have its correct
 *      noise routing silently reverted, and the song would then play that
 *      channel's next scheduled tone where the noise should have been.
 *   2. The effect asserts its own channel state AFTER the song, so on a shared
 *      channel the effect wins for the duration of its burst.
 *   3. When the burst ends, the effect restores the mixer to tone-only and calls
 *      vxtMusicReassertChannel(), which snaps the channel straight back to
 *      whatever the song's own timeline currently specifies. Without that call
 *      the channel would sit at the effect's final register values until the
 *      song's next scheduled note for it, which can be many frames later and
 *      reads as that channel falling out of time with the other two.
 * ======================================================================== */

/* ===== EXAMPLE ASSET 2 of 3: the explosion effect ==========================
 * A noise burst on one borrowed channel with a linear volume decay. No tone and
 * no AY hardware envelope register are involved; the amplitude ramp is computed
 * here, one value per frame.
 *
 * THE BORROWING CONTRACT, which is the point of the page:
 *   - The song owns all three channels and continues to play on all three.
 *   - The explosion takes ONE channel, the SECOND of the three (channel B), and
 *     takes it ONLY for the frames it is actually sounding. Outside a burst it
 *     holds nothing and the song has all three channels back.
 *   - Channels A and C are never written by the effect, and the mixer
 *     recomputation leaves their tone routing untouched.
 *   - On expiry the channel is re-synced to the song. See the RE-SYNC block
 *     below, which is the half of this that is easy to leave out.
 * A single fixed channel is used rather than whichever channel happens to be
 * quietest: the choice must be predictable, because the re-sync and the mixer
 * recomputation both depend on knowing which channel to restore.
 *
 * THE DATA VALUES ARE THE FOUR CONSTANTS BELOW. To retune the effect, change
 * these and nothing else:
 *
 *     VXC_BOOM_FRAMES   total duration in frames
 *     VXC_BOOM_NTYPE    the AY 5-bit noise period; lower is brighter/hissier
 *     VXC_BOOM_VOL_MAX  the amplitude ceiling, 0-15
 *     VXC_BOOM_CHAN     which channel is borrowed
 *
 * The decay shape is `vol = framesRemaining >> 1`, clamped to VOL_MAX, so the
 * volume tracks the remaining duration and reaches zero exactly as the burst
 * expires. At 43 frames the ceiling is reached for the first 13 frames and the
 * ramp occupies the remaining 30.

/* THE PER-FRAME PAIR BUDGET, and why the mixer write below is change-gated.
 *
 * vxtSoundReg() accepts at most VXT_SND_MAX_PAIRS (14) register/value pairs per
 * frame and SILENTLY DISCARDS anything beyond that. There is no error and no
 * flag. The costs are: vxtSoundTone() writes 3 pairs (fine period, coarse period,
 * amplitude), vxtSoundMixer() 1, and vxtSoundNoise() 1.
 *
 * The worst case on this page reaches the cap exactly:
 *
 *     song firing events on all three channels      3 x 3 = 9
 *     a channel returned this frame: mixer + reassert   1 + 3 = 4
 *                                                   ---------

 *     an effect granted on the same frame: noise + mixer  + 2  = 15
 *
 * The two writes past 14 would be discarded, and the one most likely to be lost
 * is the mixer's noise routing - which is audible as an explosion coming out as a
 * tone rather than noise, precisely the failure the shared-register rule above
 * warns about.
 *
 * Two mitigations are applied. First, the mixer is change-gated below, so a
 * recomputation that yields the same routing costs nothing - the same technique
 * vxtSmartIntensity() uses for the same reason. Second, the page displays the
 * pair count each frame, so saturation is observable rather than silent.
 *
 * If an application genuinely needs more, VXT_SND_MAX_PAIRS is the constant to
 * raise: the 6809 service loop terminates on a $FF register byte rather than a
 * count, so a longer block is serviced correctly with no assembly change, at the
 * cost of one Sound_Byte call per additional pair.

 * RE-SYNC: returning a borrowed channel to the song
 *
 * This is the part of channel borrowing that is easy to omit and whose absence
 * is audible, so it is worth setting out precisely what is and is not out of
 * step when an effect finishes.
 *
 * WHAT NEVER DESYNCS: the song's timeline. vxtMusicUpdate() is called every
 * frame unconditionally, whoever owns which channel. Inside it, each channel's
 * countdown is decremented and any event whose delta has elapsed is fired, which
 * both writes the AY and updates the player's own record of that channel's
 * current note. The sequencer therefore advances through the borrow exactly as
 * it would have done otherwise. The song does not lose its place, and nothing
 * needs rewinding or seeking.
 *
 * WHAT DOES DESYNC: the channel's HARDWARE REGISTERS. While the effect owns the
 * channel it overwrites that channel's amplitude, and in the explosion's case
 * the mixer routes the channel to the noise generator instead of its tone
 * oscillator. When the effect expires, those registers still hold the effect's
 * final values. The player will not correct them, because it writes a channel
 * only when that channel has an event to fire - and the next event may be many
 * frames away. Until then the channel sits silent, or on a stale value, while
 * the other two continue. That is what is heard as one channel falling out of
 * time with the rest, and the further apart the song's events are on that
 * channel, the longer it lasts.
 *
 * THE RE-SYNC, therefore, is not a resynchronisation of time. It is the act of
 * bringing the hardware back into agreement with a timeline that was never
 * wrong. Two writes, in this order:
 *
 *   1. RESTORE THE ROUTING. Recompute the mixer from current ownership, so the
 *      returned channel is routed to its tone oscillator again. The other two
 *      channels are recomputed at the same time and are unaffected, having never
 *      been touched.
 *
 *   2. RE-ASSERT THE CHANNEL. vxtMusicReassertChannel(ch) writes the period and
 *      amplitude the sequencer currently holds for that channel, which is either
 *      a real note still sounding or a legitimate silence if the note happened
 *      to end during the burst. Either way the channel resumes at the position
 *      the song is actually at, on the frame the channel comes back, rather than
 *      at its next event.
 *
 * The order matters because the re-assert writes only the tone and amplitude
 * registers and never the mixer: re-emitting a tone into a channel still routed
 * to the noise generator would be inaudible.
 *
 * WHEN NO SONG IS PLAYING there is no sequencer to interrogate, and the
 * re-assert is a no-op by design. The channel's amplitude must then be zeroed
 * explicitly, or it holds the effect's final value indefinitely.
 *
 * ONE FURTHER ORDERING CONSEQUENCE, for the frames DURING a burst rather than at
 * its end: the player keeps writing the borrowed channel whenever the song has
 * an event for it. Those writes are harmless only because the effects assert
 * after the player within the same frame, so the effect's amplitude is the last
 * value written, and because the mixer is routing noise rather than tone on that
 * channel anyway. Reverse the two and the song audibly interrupts the effect.

 * SECTION 6 - THE PAGES, AND THE ON-SCREEN TEXT
 *
 * ===== EXAMPLE ASSET 3 of 3: the stroke font ==============================
 *
 * All text on screen is drawn by vxt_smart_text (code/stm32/vxt/), which is a
 * toolkit module rather than an asset of this application. The data value is its
 * glyph table:
 *
 *     glyphs[] in vxt/vxt_smart_text.c     <-- the font data
 *
 * Each glyph is a short list of line-segment strokes on a grid three units wide
 * and five tall. For each stroke the pen performs a blanked move to the stroke's
 * start if it is not already there, then draws to its end. After a glyph's
 * strokes, one blanked move returns the pen to the glyph's own origin and one
 * further move advances it by a fixed glyph width, so the net displacement per
 * character is identical regardless of how many strokes the character required.
 * That invariant is what allows an entire string to be rendered as one
 * continuous pen path from a single recenter, rather than one recenter per
 * character.
 *
 * TEXT COSTS RECORDS, AND THE FIGURES ARE LARGER THAN THEY APPEAR. Each stroke
 * costs a blanked move plus a draw, so two records, and each glyph adds a return
 * to its origin and an advance. Counted against this font's own table, an
 * average upper-case character costs approximately 6 records and a 30-character
 * line approximately 125.
 *
 * The consequences were computed before this page layout was chosen, rather than
 * discovered on hardware:
 *
 *   - A three-line help block of 30-character lines, plus a title and a verbose
 *     readout, measured 641 records. That is at or above the entire 50Hz timing
 *     budget of 510 to 730 records BEFORE any geometry, and would therefore
 *     flicker unconditionally.
 *   - A twelve-line page describing every page and control measured 1501
 *     records, which exceeds even the 1536-record MEMORY bound. A full-screen
 *     help page is not affordable on this platform at any frame rate.
 *
 * What is affordable is a title, two short lines, and a compact readout, which
 * measures 263 to 288 records depending on the page and leaves 222 to 442 for
 * geometry. That is the layout below, and it is why the lines are short.
 *
 * Because 288 records is a material fraction of the budget, the title and the
 * two hint lines are TOGGLEABLE with button 2 on every page except SOUND, where
 * button 2 already triggers an effect. The compact readout is always drawn, so
 * that the cost of the text it accompanies can be observed directly: turn the
 * text off and T falls by approximately 200.
 *
 * The text is drawn AFTER the page's own geometry so that the record counter can
 * report the two separately. See the readout at the end of Section 7.

/* --- PAGE 0: the record cost of one picture drawn two ways -----------------
 *
 * Six horizontal lines of increasing length. Button 3 selects the technique.
 *
 * ONE RECORD (default). gamelibDrawAutoLine() selects the least expensive
 * routine that reaches the line. A single SmartList record draws (dy,dx) as
 * (sy*s, sx*s) with |sy| and |sx| at most 100, so the scale s is constrained
 * only from below; any larger s is equally legal and still occupies one record.
 * The ladder exploits that freedom: scale 32 reaches 3200 units in 67 cycles
 * and scale 64 reaches 6400 in 97. A short edge that would otherwise have paid
 * scale 64 saves 30 cycles at the same single record, because Timer 1 counts
 * down from the SCALE rather than the line's length, so a 2000-unit edge at
 * scale 64 waits exactly as long as a 6400-unit one.
 *
 * CHAINED. The same lines constructed from short scale-12 segments via
 * gamelibChainDelta(). The record count rises accordingly. This is the cost of
 * obtaining precision by adding records, and the reason that practice is
 * avoided: the 6809 is the bottleneck and the STM32 occupies only 7 to 11
 * percent of a frame, so STM32 cycles should be spent and 6809 records
 * conserved.
 *
 * THE TIERED WAIT is the underlying 6809 mechanism, implemented in
 * vxt_smart.asm. Each draw routine starts Timer 1 and then waits out the beam
 * ramp, with a pad of (scale-9)/2 NOPs. Scale 12 therefore requires 1 NOP,
 * scale 32 requires 12, and scale 64 requires 27. A separate routine exists per
 * scale rather than one parameterized routine because the pad is fixed at
 * assembly time and cannot know which scale is loaded when it executes.
 * Under-padding is not a rounding error but the positional drift the pad exists
 * to prevent. The wait is the draw: Timer 1 runs for `scale` ticks because that
 * is the beam's sweep duration, so the NOPs are not overhead. For a scale chosen
 * at runtime a fourth option exists: SM_startDrawHuge_d polls the timer flag
 * instead of padding, which is correct at any scale at approximately 2.2 times
 * the dispatch cost. */

 * SECTION 7 - THE PER-FRAME HANDLER (RPC 78)
 *
 * This function and everything it calls constitute the frame path.
 *
 * I/O audit for this handler, performed by walking the call graph rather than
 * by grepping this function's body, a body-only grep reporting no hits here
 * because vxcPageCal() lies one level below:
 *
 *   vxcoop_handler -> vxcPageCal -> vxtCalSaveRow    blocking, but gated on a
 *                                                    button edge, which is the
 *                                                    permitted one-shot pattern
 *   no f_open, f_gets, f_read, f_write or vxtCalLoad* reachable
 *
 * Both questions must be asked separately: whether a call is reachable from the
 * frame path, and whether it is gated on a one-shot. Reachable and ungated is
 * the defect.
 *
 * Structure, in which the order is significant:
 *   1. read input from parmRam, which is write-only from the 6809 side: the
 *      6809 cannot read those bytes back, and the STM32 must not attempt to
 *      signal the 6809 through them, STM32-to-6809 data traveling in the
 *      served image
 *   2. advance application state
 *   3. one vxtSoundBegin()/vxtSoundEnd() span
 *   4. one vxtSmartBegin()/vxtSmartEnd() span, bounded by the region's own
 *      capacity and never by the outer full-image bound, since too large a
 *      bound permits one region to overwrite an adjacent one
