 * THE MEASUREMENT. Independent hardware measurements find that a DRAWN
 * line covers less physical distance than a blanked REPOSITION does, for
 * the same nominal delta. On a test screen where the reference tick, the
 * line's start and the measuring caret are ALL placed by the move path and
 * only the line body uses the draw path, so the comparison isolates
 * exactly this:
 *
 *   L =  2,000  ->  -5.00%      L =  8,000  ->  -5.64%
 *   L =  4,000  ->  -4.23%      L = 16,000  ->  -6.86%
 *
 * WHY THIS MISALIGNS A CHAINED FIGURE AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT REPOSITION.
 * If a figure reaches each vertex by chaining drawn edges while some other
 * element reaches those same vertices by an independent reposition, and
 * drawn deltas fall ~5% short, the chained figure's accumulated position
 * drifts from nominal while the independently-repositioned element sits
 * exactly on nominal. Around a shape of ~10,000-unit edges that is hundreds
 * to thousands of units - large enough to be visible. A scale-quantisation
 * correction (rounding error of only tens of units) does not explain or fix
 * this; the gain error is one to two orders of magnitude larger.
 *
 * `per1000` is the multiplier applied to every DRAWN delta, in thousandths:
 * 1000 = identity, 1053 = "draw 5.3% further to match the move path".
 *
 * COSTS ZERO 6809 RECORDS - it changes the numbers inside records that were
 * being emitted anyway, and is pure STM32 arithmetic.
 *
 * Applies to DRAW paths only, never to moves/repositions: the move path is
 * the reference this is being corrected TOWARDS, so correcting it too would
 * just move the target.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL. The measured spread is real and unexplained - one test
 * reads ~4-7%, another's non-first elements read ~3% - so one constant
 * cannot be right everywhere yet. Whether it is scale-dependent is
 * genuinely unknown (it was measured at only one length). Treat the first
 * value as a hypothesis to be tested on hardware, not a settled
 * calibration. */

 * where a reference mark drawn at nominal (0,0) actually lands against a
 * known physical position.
 *
 * `offY`/`offX` are in the same physical units as gamelibRepositionAbs()'s

 * compensation - a DAC-zero shift is a fixed offset in deflection space,
 * not something the proportional move-gain correction should scale.
 *
 * Applied to ABSOLUTE POSITIONS ONLY (gamelibRepositionAbs()), never to

 * (`vxtSmartTextBegin()`, a separate primitive in vxt_smart_text.c) does
 * NOT go through gamelibRepositionAbs() and is untouched by this - a real

/* BEAM PRIMING - call once per frame, right after gamelibBeamBegin(), BEFORE

 *
 * WHY. Measured on hardware: the FIRST element drawn in a frame lands
 * significantly misplaced. On test screens where a like-for-like comparison
 * is possible - all items the same size and draw path - the first-drawn
 * item's error is 2.5x, 2.9x and 4.8x the mean of every other item on its
 * own screen. The cleanest case is a 12-spoke starburst: spoke 0 reads +403
 * units while all eleven others sit in a coherent 107-230 band.
 *
 * This also explains why drawing a reference figure first (before the real
 * geometry) reads as "better centered" - drawing several repositions first
 * means the real geometry is no longer the frame's first element.
 *
 * The presumed mechanism is that a recenter does not fully zero the analog
 * integrators in one go, and its residual depends on where the beam was
 * beforehand - which is why the error does not simply cancel out of the
 * arithmetic the way a constant offset would.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: not a calibration value. There is no per-unit constant
 * to measure or store here - it is a structural fix that costs a handful of
 * blanked records and applies to every unit. Whether the RIGHT number of
 * cycles is 1, 2 or 8 IS measurable on a hardware test screen.
 *
 * Cost: ~6 records per cycle, all blanked (invisible). At the default 2
 * that is ~12 of the 1536-record frame budget, under 1%.
 *
 * Each cycle drives the beam to an offset and then re-zeroes, so it
 * exercises both candidate mechanisms at once (repeated zero assertion,

/* DRAW SCALE LADDER.
 *
 * gb_dispatch_auto() picks the smallest nop-calibrated draw routine that
 * still reaches the line, instead of paying scale 64 for everything:
 *
 *   scale 32  reaches 3200 units,  67 cyc   SM_startDraw32_d  (12 nops)
 *   scale 64  reaches 6400 units,  97 cyc   SM_startDrawBig_d (27 nops)
 *
 * SM_startDrawBig_d spends 52 of its 97 cycles in NOPs waiting out the
 * scale-64 beam ramp, and Timer 1 counts down from the SCALE rather than
 * the line's length - so a 2000-unit edge waits exactly as long as a
 * 6400-unit one. Every edge in 1200..3200 therefore drops 30 cycles at the
 * same single record. Strict improvement on the original all-scale-64
 * behavior: the ladder never picks a coarser routine, only a finer one
 * where that still reaches.
 *
 * WHY SCALE 12 IS NOT ON THE LADDER, learned on hardware.
 * It is cheaper still (45 cyc) and was tried first, giving a large speed
 * win with no timing blackouts - but it is the one draw scale with no
 * divisor relationship to the reposition scale (32). Repositions land on
 * multiples of 32; scale-64 and scale-32 draws land on that same grid
 * (64 = 2*32), while multiples of 12 only coincide with it every 96 units.
 * Vertices reached by a short edge could therefore miss the same vertex
 * reached by a reposition by ~22 units, which showed on hardware as
 * adjoining mesh/hull lines drawing as two separate dots, and as a
 * meter/gauge line reading incomplete due to reduced dwell brightness.
 * Scale 12 also dwells 5.3x less than scale 64, so its lines are markedly
 * dimmer, which is exactly that second symptom.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: the grid argument explains a chained edge meeting an
 * INDEPENDENTLY repositioned one. It does NOT by itself explain a failure
 * between two edges inside one tracked chain, and that gap has not been
 * closed - the ladder avoids the whole question by staying grid-safe rather
 * than by having proven the mechanism.
 *
 * TUNING. GAMELIB_LADDER_SCALE_LO is the fast tier. 32 is the smallest
 * grid-safe value; setting it to 64 disables the ladder entirely and
 * restores the original all-scale-64 behavior (the one-constant rollback).

 * WHY THESE EXIST, measured not assumed: vxtSmartScale() is NOT change-gated

 * `scale(bigScale) ... scale(gb_draw_scale)`. So a chained edge that emits
 * one real draw record costs THREE, and two of the three exist only to set
 * a scale the very next edge immediately sets back. Simulating the exact
 * emitted record stream for a complex chained model put that waste at 54%
 * of the whole object's record count - the single largest line item,
 * larger than the recenters themselves.
 *
 * The fix: set the scale ONCE for a run of draws, emit bare draw records

 * changes - every edge is emitted at exactly the scale it was already

 * where it should.
 *
 * THE OFFSET GOES ON THE TARGET, NEVER ON THE DELTA. This is the whole trap,
 * and it is not obvious: chained draws in this scheme are SELF-CORRECTING -
 * each segment computes its delta from the beam's TRACKED position to that
 * vertex's absolute target. Add a correction to a delta and the very next
 * segment re-aims from the corrected position and cancels it exactly. Adding
 * it to the TARGETS is what actually moves the landing point:
 *
 *     target[k] += (D * k) / n        k = 1..n
 *
 * After n segments the accumulated offset is exactly D, nulling the miss;
 * intermediate vertices shift proportionally, which reads as a smooth unwind
 * rather than a kink.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST CHANGE THE DRAW GAIN: a uniform gain CANNOT change a closed
 * figure's closure at all. It scales every delta, and a closed figure's
 * deltas sum to zero, so g*0 = 0. Only an ASYMMETRIC correction - one that
 * treats the return path differently from the outbound one - has any
 * authority over where a closed chain lands. Measured directly on hardware:
 * re-fitting the draw gain alone did nothing for a large closed figure's
 * closure error.
 *
 * COSTS ZERO 6809 RECORDS - same records, same scales, just different
 * numbers inside them.
 *
 * `k` is 1-based; k==n returns exactly (dy,dx) with no rounding drift, which
 * matters because that is the segment that has to land. */
