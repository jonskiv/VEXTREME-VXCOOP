/* MOVE-path gain - the counterpart to gb_draw_gain above, which did not

 *
 * Every gb_gain_apply() call site is a DRAW. gamelibRepositionAbs() passed
 * raw coordinates straight through, so a hardware scale error on the move
 * ramp was completely uncompensated while draws were corrected by +5.3%.
 *
 * A hardware test rig measured it directly. Error at a figure's landing
 * point, against how far its opening reposition travels:
 *
 *   travel      0  ->  205 units   (no travel at all)
 *   travel   6000  ->  800         (mean of a full sweep)
 *   travel   6000  ->  900         (an independent figure, for comparison)
 *   travel  10630  -> 1262
 *
 * A line through the two ENDPOINTS gives error = 205 + 0.0994*travel, and
 * that predicts the un-fitted 6000-travel points to within ~100 units - a
 * prediction, not a curve fit. So the move OVERSHOOTS by ~9.9%, plus a
 * ~205-unit fixed term that survives at zero travel.
 *
 * This gain corrects the proportional 9.9%. The fixed term is deliberately
 * NOT corrected here: it does not scale, so it needs a different mechanism,
 * and it is worth confirming the dominant term first. Costs zero 6809
 * records - it changes the value in a record that was being emitted anyway,
 * exactly like the draw gain.
 *
 * NOTE the move and draw gains point in OPPOSITE directions (moves overshoot,
 * draws fall short). That is not a contradiction: SM_startMoveBig_d and
 * SM_startDrawBig_d carry different, independently hand-computed nop padding
 * (the scale-64 draw pairing is flagged UNVERIFIED in vxt_smart.asm), so the
 * two paths have no reason to share a timing error. */

 * DROP (3100 -> 1014 but 3300 -> 506): one more record means each step is
 * smaller. It also predicts figures it was not fitted on - a 6000-unit
 * reposition is 2 steps of 94, predicting 940 against 825-955 measured on

 * Physically: the final step's ramp has not finished settling when the draw
 * begins, leaving an offset proportional to that ramp's slew. It explains the
 * two failed fixes too - a distance gain changed the distance but not the
 * step COUNT, so the step size barely moved and neither did the error; and
 * beam priming could not help because the fault is per-move, not a one-off
 * warm-up.
 *
 * Correcting it means emitting E such that E + k*(E/scale/steps) = target,
 * i.e. E = target * (100*scale*steps) / (100*scale*steps + k), with k in

 * USED is whatever this function privately computed (`neededScale`,

     *
     * A single record draws (dy,dx) as (sy*s, sx*s) with |sy|,|sx| <=
     * GB_MAX_RATE. That constrains s only from BELOW: s must be at least
     * ceil(maxAbs/GB_MAX_RATE), but ANY larger s is equally legal and
     * still exactly ONE record. This function used to take the smallest
     * legal s unconditionally - the right choice for minimizing record
     * COUNT, but it left the remaining freedom completely unused, and the
     * endpoint error it produces is +-s/2 per axis.
     *
     * That error is what misaligned a chained ring against its own
     * connectors: measured by simulating the exact emitted record stream,
     * the outer ring's vertices landed up to 47 units from ideal and up to
     * 61 units from where the independently-repositioned connectors start
     * (~3px) - small in absolute terms, but each vertex carries a bright
     * dwell dot, which is exactly where a few pixels are most visible.
     * (This also explains why the position-tracking fix above - a real
     * bug, correctly fixed - did not move the symptom: it corrected which
     * position was TRACKED, not how coarsely the endpoint was Quantized.)
     *
     * Fix: search a small window of legal scales and keep the one whose
     * rounding lands closest to the true endpoint. Still ONE record, still
     * the single-big-line dispatch this file already had - the search
     * costs only STM32 cycles (a few dozen divides), which is the right
     * place to spend, since the 6809 is the constrained CPU and its record
     * count is unchanged. Measured result: worst vertex error 47 -> 16
     * units, ring-vs-connector gap 61 -> 4 units (0.2px).
     *
     * DO NOT "fix" precision here by capping the scale and chaining more
     * records - that was tried once and reverted the same day. It defeats
     * the entire purpose of the Huge/Huge16 single-record path, whose
     * reason for existing is 6809 cycle savings over chaining. Precision
     * and record count are NOT a necessary tradeoff; the scale search gets
