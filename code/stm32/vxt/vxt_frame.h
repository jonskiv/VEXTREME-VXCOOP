/*
 * vxt_frame.h - VXT toolkit: vector-list writer (STM32 side). GPLv3.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * Writes vector records into the served image at a fixed offset, using the
 * byte format confirmed directly from Sprite_tm's original VOOM source
 * (voom-voom_asm.txt) - NOT from its header comment,
 * which describes a run-length format the assembled code does not actually
 * implement.
 *
 * Format, 4 bytes per vector record:
 *   byte0 = intensity ($00-$7F). Bit 6 ($40) set = "recenter to origin
 *           first" (VOOM's code masks this byte with $3F, not $7F, before
 *           calling Intensity_a in that case - so a recenter record's
 *           usable intensity is 0-63, not the full 0-127 the BIOS INTENS
 *           routine (Vol.2, $F2AB) actually supports. A quirk of the
 *           reference implementation; not required to preserve, noted for
 *           accuracy).
 *   byte1 = scale, loaded directly into VIA_t1_cnt_lo (line length/duration).
 *   byte2 = coord1 (first axis, written to VIA_port_a).
 *   byte3 = coord2 (second axis, written to VIA_port_a after an S/H strobe).
 * Sentinel: intensity byte == $FF ends the list.
 *
 * Offset $0800 is this project's adopted convention, matching VOOM's own
 * choice - NOT a universal requirement, just the
 * address both the STM32 writer and the 6809 draw loop must agree on.
 *
 * vxtImgPut() implements the bank-mirroring rule: romemu.S inverts
 * PB6/A15, so a runtime write into the 64K cartData buffer must be
 * mirrored into both 32K banks, but a write into the 20K menuData
 * buffer must not be, mirroring there overflowing it. vxt_sound.c
 * reuses this single implementation rather than duplicating the rule.

 * permanently - a real failure mode, not a hypothetical one, at as few as
 * ~85 boxes' worth of records under an earlier, smaller sound offset. Sound
 * now sits at $2000, giving ($2000-$0800)/4 = 1536 records; this bound keeps
