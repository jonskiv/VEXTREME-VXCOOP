/* Changed - REAL HARDWARE BUG FIX, not a hardening tweak.
 * `sm_rec()` above silently drops every record once the budget is hit,
 * and that INCLUDED the closing terminator `vxtSmartEnd()` writes. A
 * dropped terminator means the 6809's SmartList walker never stops - it
 * runs off the end of the valid list into whatever stale bytes sit there
 * and executes them as bogus routine addresses. Observed on real
 * hardware as the whole app apparently rebooting mid-frame (jumping back
 * to its own boot animation), and as stray lines, whenever a frame's
 * content got heavy enough to overrun - exactly the failure mode a busy
 * frame (cockpit overlay ON + two full-detail enemies straddling the
 * window edge) now reaches routinely.
 *
 * FIX: reserve one record slot for the terminator up front, so overflow
 * degrades to DROPPED GEOMETRY (a visibly incomplete but structurally
 * VALID list the 6809 walks and terminates normally) instead of an
 * unterminated list that crashes it. The budget the rest of the frame
 * sees is one smaller; `vxtSmartEnd()` then always has somewhere to go.
 * Overflow is still reported via vxtSmartOverflowed() - this makes the
 * failure survivable and diagnosable, it does NOT make it acceptable;
 * callers still need to fit the budget. */
