/* Added, real bug found via direct feedback ("sounds very
 * staticy and noisy, not clear sounds") - NOTHING in this project ever
 * wrote the AY's mixer register (reg 7, which selects tone vs. noise per
 * channel) to enable the 3 TONE channels. vxtSoundTone() only ever touches
 * the period/amp registers, never the mixer - it assumed the mixer was
 * already in a sane state. The only mixer write anywhere in the game's own
 * code is the explosion effect's `vxtSoundMixer(0, VXT_MIX_NOISE_A)`, which disables
 * ALL THREE tone channels and routes noise onto channel A, and is never
 * restored afterward - so any explosion firing earlier in the same
 * power-on session (or just the AY's own post-reset register state) could
 * leave tone output disabled/noise-routed indefinitely, which reads as
 * exactly "staticky/noisy" instead of clean tones. Fixed by having
 * playback claim the correct mixer state itself on start, rather than
 * assuming a caller elsewhre already left it right - deferred to the
 * first vxtMusicUpdate() call (not done here in vxtMusicPlay() itself)
 * because THIS function is called from outside the shared vxtSoundBegin/
 * End span (see vxt_music.h's own header) and must not touch the AY
 * directly.
 *
 * Widened after a real bug found via direct feedback ("when i switch
 * from leia to rey, there was a drone that persisted that didn't belong -
 * i think it's from channel C of the prior track"): this flag used to
 * only queue the mixer write. A channel switch never independently
 * SILENCED anything - if the outgoing song left a channel's amp non-zero
 * and the incoming song's FIRST event on that same channel isn't at frame
 * 0 (i.e. its initial countdown is > 0), that channel keeps sounding the
 * OLD song's last note, unchanged, until the new song's own first event
 * for it eventually fires. Now this same one-time hook also queues
 * vxtSoundSilence() (all 3 amps -> 0) BEFORE the normal per-channel loop
 * runs its frame-0 events, in the SAME vxtMusicUpdate() call - so a
 * channel with a real frame-0 event gets silenced then immediately
 * overwritten with its real note (net effect: no change), while a channel
 * with no frame-0 event just stays silenced, instead of inheriting
 * whatever the last song left there. */
static int vm_need_start_init;

/* Added - Leia/Rey still played too slowly even with
 * the correct tempo VALUES read straight from the .vpy (100 BPM for both -
 * confirmed against the source file, not a misread), which means the bug
 * is in tools/vpy_to_music.py's TICK duration assumption (specifically,
 * what "ticksPerBeat" means as a note-length unit - e.g. whether the
 * tool's "beat" is a quarter note as assumed, or a finer subdivision),
 * not the BPM number itself. Rather than keep guessing at Vectrex Studio's
 * internal semantics, this is a live-adjustable RATE multiplier so the
 * right value can be found by ear on real hardware - whatever value fixes
 * it can then be folded into the converter as a fixed scale (or the
 * ticksPerBeat interpretation corrected directly) once known. 1.0 = the
 * generated data's own nominal speed (matches the OLD unconditional
 * per-frame-tick behavior exactly when left at 1.0 - not a behavior change
 * for any existing caller). Accumulator-based so ANY rate (not just whole
 * multiples) is exact over time, not just approximated frame-to-frame. */
/* Changed, per direct feedback after the real-time decoupling
 * fix (see vm_last_ms's own comment below) - "the decoupling helped with
 * the speed of the midi playback... reduce by about 10%". This is now the
 * FIRST real-tempo feedback given against a stable, frame-rate-independent
 * baseline (every earlier tempo comment predates that fix and was
 * confounded by it), so it's baked in as the new default rather than left
 * for the user to dial in by hand via the live RATE control every session -
 * that control (`vxtMusicSetRate()`) still works identically on top of
 * this new baseline for any further by-ear tuning.
 *
 * Changed again - 0.9 * 0.85 = 0.765. Same reasoning as above:
 * this is feedback against the already-fixed real-time-based baseline, so
 * it's compounded into the default rather than left as a manual RATE
 * nudge.
 *
 * Changed again, per direct feedback
 * ("slow down another 5%") - 0.765 * 0.95 = 0.72675, rounded to 0.727.
 *
 * Changed, per direct feedback after the vm_tick() off-by-one
 * fix (see that function's own comment) - "tempo is a tad too fast now,
 * slow down about 5% for all songs": 0.727 was hand-tuned against the OLD
 * buggy vm_tick(), which fired every event one tick late (a built-in
 * per-event delay that read as extra slowness). With that bug fixed,
 * playback runs faster at the same vm_rate, hence the report. This IS a
 * GLOBAL, SHARED variable (Changed: a per-scene override now
 * exists in the game's own init code for one scene's music - the old
 * live RATE control was removed and nothing else called
 * vxtMusicSetRate() before that addition), so THIS value - the baseline
 * every fresh vxtMusicPlay() call resets to, see that function's own
 * comment - retunes every song in every OTHER state identically (Scene
 * 1/2/4 backgrounds included), not just the Game Info jukebox where this
 * was originally noticed. Does NOT reintroduce cross-channel
 * misalignment: vm_rate only scales how fast vm_accum fills up, i.e. how
 * often vm_tick() itself gets called - every call still ticks all 3
 * channels together in the same lockstep loop, so this is orthogonal to
 * the per-channel countdown logic the off-by-one fix touched.
 * 0.727 * 0.95 = 0.69065, rounded to 0.691.
 *
 * Changed - was a bare 0.691f here; now VXT_MUSIC_RATE_DEFAULT
 * (vxt_music.h), the SAME constant vxtMusicPlay() resets to on every
 * fresh song start and the same one the game's own scene-init code
 * derives its first per-scene override from - one canonical number
 * instead of this value being duplicated by hand wherever "the normal
 * rate" is needed. No behavior change here, this
 * static's own initial value is identical either way; the actual
 * per-scene-override mechanism is new, see vxtMusicPlay()'s own comment. */
