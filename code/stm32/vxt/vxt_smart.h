 * vxt_smart.h - VXT toolkit: SmartList emitter (STM32 side). GPLv3.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * Emits the (A, B, subroutine-address) triples consumed by vxt_smart.asm's
 * pulu-dispatch draw engine. See that file for the technique, its source
 * (Malban / Kristof), and the measured ~2.2x speedup over vxt_draw.
 *
 * The 6809-side routine addresses are NOT known to the STM32 at compile time -
 * they land wherever the 6809 app links them. The app therefore publishes them
 * once at startup via an RPC (see VXT_RPC_ID_SMART_ADDRS), and the emitter
 * fills in the table below. Emitting before the table is populated is a no-op,
 * which fails visibly (blank screen) rather than by jumping the 6809 into
 * garbage.
