 * vxt_cal_load.h - VXT toolkit: reads the calibration rig's own
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 * /calmeas.csv log (see vxt_cal.c) and derives the TEXT H per-character

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A calibration value measured on one physical unit is
 * specific to that unit's own analog drift - hardcoding a fitted
 * constant into a game's firmware bakes in one machine's number
 * permanently, which is wrong the moment that cart's SD card (or the
 * cart itself) moves to different hardware. This module instead
 * re-derives the correction from whatever /calmeas.csv is actually on
 * THIS SD card at THIS boot - the same file the calibration rig
 * (code/app6809/test8_cal, vxt_cal.c) already writes. No CSV format is
 * duplicated by invention here - just re-read with the same field order.

 * readings are excluded because the reference card overlay itself has
 * been observed to change where text lands, and real gameplay text never
 * draws with that overlay on screen).
 *
 * Returns 1 and fills cross and along if at least one usable card-off
 * TEXT H end reference was found; returns 0 and leaves both UNTOUCHED
 * if the file is missing, empty, or has no usable TEXT H data - callers
 * must default to identity (0,0) themselves in that case (this function

 * PHASE B - the two Class-I drawing corrections, read from this
 * machine's own /calmeas.csv instead of being compiled in.
 *
 * These exist because of a real architectural defect: the calibration system's
 * stated purpose is "a runtime, PER-UNIT calibration system... values
 * persisted to the board, loaded at boot, and applied inside the shared
 * drawing primitives" - and until now only TEXT H did that. The two geometry
 * corrections were fitted on ONE Vectrex and hardcoded, so any other unit got
 * this machine's analog behavior baked in.
 *
 * BOTH FOLLOW vxtCalLoadTextComp()'s CONTRACT EXACTLY: return 1 and fill the
 * out-param if at least one usable row was found; return 0 and leave it
 * UNTOUCHED otherwise, so the caller supplies its own fallback. "No data" and
 * "measured zero" must stay distinguishable - silently defaulting to another
 * machine's fitted constant is precisely the bug this module exists to avoid.
 *
 * BOTH REQUIRE PROVENANCE. Only rows whose recorded drawgain is 1000 (identity,
 * which the rig forces every frame) are used. A row measured THROUGH a
 * correction is not a raw measurement of the hardware, and a row from before
 * those columns existed cannot say either way - that exact ambiguity already
 * cost one whole fitting attempt, so legacy rows are skipped, not trusted.

/* DRAW GAIN, from the ANGLE screen. Averages each spoke's RADIAL error as a
 * fraction of its radius, then returns the gain that cancels it, in
 * thousandths (1000 = identity, 1060 = "draw 6% further").
 *
 * Prefers CARD-ON rows when enough exist: the reference card absorbs the
 * first-element displacement (~800-960 units without it, 45 with), so a
 * card-on sweep isolates the draw term alone - half the scatter of any
 * card-off fit, and the reason earlier attempts disagreed. Falls back to

 *
 * Center's single reference sits at nominal (0,0) by construction, so a
 * row's own (dy,dx) directly IS the measured offset - no per-length or
 * per-radius division like TEXT H/CHORD need. Same provenance rule as the
 * other two: only rows recorded at identity draw gain (1000) are used.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WRITE SIDE - added for a game's own in-game Cal screen, which
 * needs to RECORD a measurement, not just load one at boot. Lives here
 * rather than being duplicated in the calling game's own code because
 * this module already owns the calmeas.csv column format and its parser
 * (vxtCalLoadParseField()) - a second, game-local parser would just be
 * the same format re-invented, which this whole module exists to avoid.
 * Not the rig's own vxt_cal.c (explicitly not reused).
 *
 * UPSERT, NOT APPEND: streams the existing /calmeas.csv (if any) to a temp
 * file, replacing the ONE row whose (screen,variant,ref) key matches with
 * a freshly built one and passing every other line through untouched
 * (including a full standalone-rig log's data for screens this call never
 * touches), then swaps the temp file over the original. NO in-RAM table of
 * prior rows is held at any point - the design doc's own "no RAM table"
 * decision, satisfied by streaming rather than buffering. Matches (and is
 * interoperable with) the rig's own calBuildLogLine() column order exactly:
 *   screen,variant,ref,card,refY,refX,dy,dx,records,compy,compx,nrefs,
 *   drawgain,movegain,movesettle,session,fw
 *
 * `card` is always written 0 (a game's own Cal screen tiles never draw a
 * reference-card overlay - the game already primes every frame, see
 * gamelibBeamPrime(), which is what the rig's own card-on workaround for
 * ANGLE existed to substitute for). `records`/`session`/`fw` are written 0
 * - a game has no per-reading SmartList count, boot-session counter, or
 * firmware-stamp macro of its own; none of the three feeds any loader's
 * provenance check, which looks at `drawgain` alone. `movegain`/
 * `movesettle` are written at identity (1000/0) - the Cal screen never
 * exercises either path. Caller is responsible for `drawGain` actually
 * reflecting what was active for THIS reading (1000 for a raw measurement,
 * matching what vxtCalLoadDrawGain()/vxtCalLoadClosureComp() require to
 * accept the row at all).
 *
 * Returns 1 on success, 0 if the SD card couldn't be written (caller should
 * treat this the same as any other blocked save - see the rig's own
 * calSaveLog() for the equivalent contract). Blocking SD I/O - safe to call
 * ONLY from a one-shot button-press handler, never per-frame - the rig's
 * own "flashed through black" incident is exactly what happens if this
 * rule is broken. */

 * Two different tools write measurement rows, and they are NOT
 * interchangeable even though the schema is identical:
 *
 *   - The standalone rig (code/app6809/test8_cal) writes RAW samples: a
 *     12-spoke ANGLE sweep, several CHORD variants, meant to be
 *     median-fitted across rows.
 *   - A game's own Cal screen writes ONE row per correction, reverse-derived
 *     so a loader's own formula reconstructs the value the player converged
 *     on. One row is correct there BY DESIGN; it is an encoding, not a
 *     sample.
 *
 * Sharing one file lets those collide on identical (screen,variant,ref)
 * keys - a game's synthetic ANGLE row upserts over one of the rig's real
 * measured spokes - so each tool gets its own file.
 *
 * `chordPadR` is the radial offset between a CHORD row's own refX and the
 * arc radius it was measured against (|refX| = R + chordPadR). The two
 * tools do NOT agree on it: the rig pads by 2165, a game may pad by
 * something else entirely, and assuming the wrong one rescales every
 * reconstructed closure value by the ratio of the two radii. It therefore
 * travels with the file selection rather than being a single hardcoded
 * constant.
 *
 * The STM32 is not reset when the 6809 changes carts, so this is sticky
 * state a previous cart can leave behind: EVERY consumer must set its own
 * source explicitly at boot rather than relying on the default below.
 * Passing NULL for either path restores the rig's own default. */
