 *
 * MEASUREMENT ONLY: no adjustable calibration values, no persistence, no
 * settings UI.
 *
 * THE DESIGN IN ONE PARAGRAPH. There is exactly ONE measurement primitive
 * here - a LANDING TEST: draw a figure by some draw path, then draw an
 * independently repositioned REFERENCE MARK at that figure's ideal endpoint.
 * The visible gap between them is the error. Every screen below is that same
 * primitive swept over a different axis (length, scale, record count,
 * direction, screen deflection) or applied to a different shape archetype.
 * Each archetype is a real defect pattern, stripped of any game-specific
 * geometry - generic in form, defect-derived in content, so the rig serves
 * any game on this toolkit without measuring things that never bit us.
 *
 * NOTHING IN THIS FILE MAY COST 6809 RECORDS TO BUY PRECISION. The rig
 * MEASURES the draw paths; it must never quietly improve them, or it
 * would measure itself instead of the hardware.

 *     STOP that silently made RECORD do nothing once full - indistinguishable
 *     from "the correction doesn't work".
 *   - 64-entry RING: fixed the hard stop but silently EVICTED the oldest
 *     entry. Destroyed a full SHARED sweep mid-session, including the ring's
 *     816-unit reading the whole investigation turned on.
 *   - 384 then 448 then 512-entry ring, "sized to the whole measurement
 *     space": still a hand-maintained number with no link to the screens it
 *     sized for, and it was mis-derived at least once (REPOS was recorded as
 *     costing 14 entries; it costs 22).
 * Replaced by the dense slot table below, which removes the
 * capacity question entirely rather than re-answering it.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
/* ===========================================================================
 * DENSE FIXED SLOT TABLE. Replaced the ring buffer,
 * instruction ("it should be a fixed defined array for all possible measured
 * items... it will also tell us which measures are blank and can be
 * supplemented").
 *
 * WHY THE RING HAD TO GO. cal_meas[] was a ring of 512 rows keyed by
 * (screen,variant,ref) with a linear search. Three problems, all real:
 *   1. It could still WRAP and silently evict, which had already destroyed a
 *      full SHARED sweep once. Every raise of CAL_MAX_MEAS was a guess at a
 *      number that had already been mis-derived once (an earlier note
 *      said REPOS cost 14 entries; it costs 22).
 *   2. It could not answer "what have I NOT measured yet?" - an unmeasured
 *      item and an absent row are the same thing in a sparse list.
 *   3. Its size was a hand-maintained constant with no link to the screens
 *      it was sizing for, so adding a screen silently ate the headroom.
 *
 * NOW: one slot per measurable item, ALWAYS present, addressed arithmetically
 * rather than searched:
 *
 *     slot = CAL_SLOT_BASE[screen] + variant * CAL_REFS[screen] + ref
 *
 * where `variant` counts the card-ON twins too (0 .. CAL_VARIANT_TOTAL-1).
 * Recording the same item again overwrites its own slot by construction -
 * the upsert rule is now structural instead of a search that could miss.
 * `valid` distinguishes "never measured" from "measured as zero", so the
 * readout can report coverage and point at the gaps.
 *
 * SIZE IS DERIVED FROM THE SCREEN TABLES, NOT GUESSED - and checked. Adding a
 * screen changes CAL_VARIANTS[]/CAL_REFS[] and therefore the requirement;
 * calSlotInit() recomputes the bases every boot and sets cal_slots_over if the
 * total exceeds CAL_TOTAL_SLOTS, which the readout shows as "SLOTS!". It
 * cannot fail silently the way the ring's capacity did.
 * ======================================================================== */

 * LIVE TEXT-SKEW APPLY/CONVERGE. A way to apply the CURRENTLY measured
 * TEXT H correction live, re-measure, and converge to ~0 over a few rounds
 * - rather than hand-computing a constant offline and hardcoding it into a
 * game, only to find out on the next hardware flash that it was wrong
 * (exactly what happened to an early guessed constant, see
 * vxt_smart_text.c's own history). Scoped to TEXT H (horizontal) only -
 * TEXT V's rotated-space conversion from screen-measured drift back to the
 * module's LOCAL pre-rotation (cross,along) pair is a real, unconfirmed
 * open question (see vxt_smart_text.c's own caveat), not something to
 * quietly assume correct here.
 *
 * THE CONVERGE LOOP: RECORD (button 4, on a TEXT H row's END reference -
 * the only reference with a known character count) folds that reading into
 * the accumulated cal_text_comp_cross/along; button 2 (a plain TAP) TOGGLES
 * whether the accumulated pair is actually being applied to the draw. The
 * two are independent so the mode is always exactly what the user last set,
 * never implicitly changed by taking a measurement - see calDrawReadout()'s
 * "CORR ON/OFF" line, added so this is never invisible.
 *
 * CONTROL SCHEME, revised after the first attempt didn't register on
 * hardware: this was originally a HOLD-buttons-2+3-together chord for the
 * apply toggle, freeing nothing else up. That didn't register on real
 * hardware, so it is now a plain button 2 tap instead - and since button 2
 * is no longer free for variant-cycling, variant cycling moved to button 1
 * HELD + joystick left/right (see calBtnHeld()/CAL_VARIANT_JOY_THRESHOLD
 * below), with button 1's own
 * screen-cycle now firing on RELEASE rather than press, and only if the
 * press was short enough to be a genuine tap rather than the start of a
 * hold-for-variant gesture - see the button 1 handling block in
 * vxt_cal_handler() for the exact mechanism.
 *
 * WHY FOLD-IN MUST BRANCH ON WHETHER APPLY WAS ON DURING THAT MEASUREMENT

 * silently flipped a variable nothing looked at. Extended the converge-loop
 * mechanism (apply toggle + RECORD folds the residual in, add-vs-replace on
 * whether apply was on) to line geometry, starting with SHARED (the
 * "priority case" - a shared-vertex defect in a large closed-arc model,
 * still unresolved pending a Class I vs III blocking question).
 *
 * FIRST VERSION (same day, REPLACED) decomposed the correction into each
 * connector's own local along/cross frame - modeled on text's own
 * direction-relative comp, since that's the only precedent in this file.
 * Hardware-tested and DISPROVEN: fitting the correction at one SHARED
 * vertex (the 3-o'clock one, whose local frame happens to be pure
 * screen-X) converged that vertex to ~0 residual but did NOT generalize to
 * the other five, which sit at different angles - a photo showed the
 * diagonal connectors still visibly short of their vertices while the
 * fitted one landed exactly. A direction-relative model predicts it SHOULD
 * generalize if the physical defect really is "along/across this specific
 * line's own direction." It didn't, which rules that model out.
 *
 * REPLACED WITH a flat, GLOBAL, screen-space (dy,dx) offset - the SAME
 * additive nudge applied to every test figure on every geometry screen,
 * regardless of that figure's own direction. This matches what the
 * original (pre-tool) calmeas.csv SHARED data actually showed before any
 * of this was built: dx ran a large, consistently POSITIVE 900-1400 across
 * all six differently-angled connectors - a pattern a direction-relative
 * model cannot produce (it would flip sign with direction), but a flat
 * screen-space bias produces exactly. int16_t for the same reason as
 * before - a single-segment correction needs more range than text's
 * per-character-divided int8_t. Shared across LADDER/SCALE/CHAIN/SHARED/
 * ANGLE/DEFLECT (not TEXT H, which keeps its own proven, separate
 * mechanism) so the SAME question - does one flat correction explain
 * everything, on every screen, at every angle and distance - gets
 * answered with actual breadth instead of one screen's six data points.
 *
 * Revised again (round 3) - PER-REFERENCE, not one global pair.
 * Real gap found via direct feedback ("if you look at that vertex and line
 * and all the other lines and vertices, they don't line up after I've gone
 * through and marked the end of each line... the visual with Corr=on should
 * result in the line ends and vertices connecting together"). That
 * expectation is correct and the tool did not meet it, for a structural
 * reason: ONE global (dy,dx) cannot simultaneously close six connectors
 * whose errors differ, so measuring all six just meant each RECORD
 * overwrote the last and only the final one could ever look right. Now each
 * reference index carries its OWN correction, applied to that reference's
 * OWN figure (calRef() is called in draw order by calMark()/calTick(), so
 * ref index == figure index on every geometry screen - verified per screen).
 * Measure every item on a screen and every item should visibly close up.
 *
 * THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE ORIGINAL CLASS I vs III QUESTION, it sharpens
 * it. "Does one flat correction generalize" is now answered by READING the
 * six stored numbers (identical => flat model; varying with angle/length/
 * deflection => it doesn't), which is a measurement rather than an eyeball
 * judgement. And it adds a check nothing else in the rig could make: if
 * per-item corrections, fitted per item, STILL don't visually close, then
 * the error is not repeatable frame to frame and no static calibration of
 * any shape can fix it - a decisive result the old single-value design
 * could not distinguish from "wrong model."
 *
 * Sized CAL_MAX_REFS (the same bound cal_ref_y/x already use, so any screen
 * that can register a reference can carry a correction for it): 40 * 2 *
 * int16_t = 160 bytes of bss. Reset on every screen AND variant change -
 * a variant change is different geometry, so a correction fitted to the old
 * one is meaningless, and silently keeping it would be the "stale

 *     roughly proportional), so changing the delta changes the very error
 *     just measured. Each correction perturbs its own measurement.

 * Screen 10 - REPOS. Distance-proportional or per-record?
 *
 * Added to settle a question two failed fixes could not.
 *
 * The first figure of a frame lands wrong, by an amount that grows with how
 * far its opening reposition goes: 205 units at zero travel, ~850 at 6000,
 * ~1250 at 10630. That looked proportional, so a 9% move gain was tried -
 * and did NOTHING on hardware.
 *
 * The reason is the discriminator. vxtSmartMoveBig() chains through
 * sm_chain_steps(), which emits ceil(|phys/scale|/100) RECORDS. Scaling the
 * distance by 0.91 leaves that count unchanged (2 stays 2, 3 stays 3), and
 * the error did not move either. Re-read against record count instead:
 *
 *     0 records -> 205      2 records -> ~850      3 records -> ~1250
 *
 * i.e. ~350 units per move record on a ~205 floor. Mechanically that is
 * plausible in a way the distance model never was: each SM_startMoveBig_d
 * carries hand-computed nop padding, so a slightly wrong pad contributes a
 * FIXED error once per record, no matter how far that record travels.
 *
 * THE EXPERIMENT. One figure only - it must be the first thing drawn to
 * carry the fault at all - repositioned a variant-selected distance, with an
 * independent mark at the reposition point itself (so the DRAW contributes
 * nothing to the reading). The distances straddle the record boundaries,
 * which at CAL_POS_SCALE 32 fall at phys 3200 / 6400 / 9600:
 *
 *     V0     0 -> 0 records        V4  6500 -> 3 records
 *     V1  3100 -> 1 record         V5  9500 -> 3 records
 *     V2  3300 -> 2 records        V6  9700 -> 4 records
 *     V3  6300 -> 2 records
 *
 * Distance-proportional predicts a smooth ramp across all seven.
 * Per-record predicts a STAIRCASE: V1~V2 apart despite only 200 units of
 * distance between them, V2~V3 together despite 3000 units apart, another
 * jump V4->V5->V6. The two models disagree loudly, which is the point.
 *
 * Corr is irrelevant here and should stay OFF - this measures raw behavior.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------ */
/* EXTENDED to SHORT distances. The 10x-step-size relation was only ever
 * measured from 3100 up; extrapolating it below that is what broke a real
 * game, whose first reposition of a frame is frequently a short one (a
 * reticle hash, a radar grid line). V1-V5 all sit inside a SINGLE step
 * (steps == 1 for anything under phys 3200), so within that block the
 * model predicts error rising in direct proportion to distance:
 *
 *     400 -> 120     1600 -> 500     3100 -> 960 (measured 1014, consistent)
 *     800 -> 250     2400 -> 750
 *
 * A straight ramp confirms the model down to the sizes a real game actually
 * uses. A
 * FLOOR instead - roughly constant a few hundred units regardless of distance

 * Screen 11 - ACCUM: per-record chain accumulation, ISOLATED from whole-figure
 * displacement.
 *
 * CHAIN ALREADY DRAWS A CLOSED POLYGON, but it compares
 * the chain's landing point against an INDEPENDENTLY REPOSITIONED mark, so
 * its reading is dominated by the ~900-unit first-element/whole-figure
 * displacement and cannot see per-segment accumulation underneath it. That is
 * visible in CHAIN's own numbers: 936/910/879/869/818 for N = 4/6/8/12/16, i.e.
 * flat-to-slightly-falling while the record count grows 4x. A per-record term
 * of even 30 units would have shown as +360 across that sweep and did not -
 * but it also could not have been distinguished from the displacement it is
 * buried in.
 *
 * THE ISOLATION TRICK: measure the chain's OWN START against the chain's OWN
 * END - both ends of a single chained run, with no independent reposition
 * anywhere in the comparison. A whole-figure displacement moves BOTH by the
 * same amount and cancels exactly in the difference; only genuine
 * accumulation survives. Formally, with D = displacement and A = accumulation:
 *
 *     ref 0 (chain START) error = D
 *     ref 1 (chain END)   error = D + A
 *     ACCUMULATION        = (ref 1) - (ref 0)          <- subtract by hand
 *
 * This is the measurement an open arch-closure defect in a large closed-loop
 * model needs: its arch is ~17 chained segments that must land back on the
 * point a move established, and every non-accumulation explanation has
 * already been ruled out on hardware.
 *
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR - the point of the variant layout. Two sweeps that a
 * fixed-per-record error and a length-proportional error answer OPPOSITELY:
 *
 *   V0-V3  RECORD COUNT sweep, N = 4/8/16/32 at fixed R - record count grows
 *          8x while path length stays within ~11% (an inscribed N-gon's
 *          perimeter is already near 2*pi*R by N=8).
 *            fixed-per-record  -> accumulation grows ~8x
 *            proportional      -> accumulation stays flat
 *
 *   V2,V4-V6  PATH LENGTH sweep, R = 2000/4000/6000/9000 at fixed N=16 -
 *          path length grows 4.5x at constant record count. (V2 is the shared
 *          corner of both sweeps: N=16, R=6000. Measure it once, use it in
 *          both columns.)
 *            fixed-per-record  -> accumulation stays flat
 *            proportional      -> accumulation grows ~4.5x
 *
 * Both growing means both terms are real and the fit needs both. Neither
 * growing means chain accumulation is NOT the arch's mechanism, which is
 * an equally useful result - it would send that investigation back to a
 * move-vs-draw gain disagreement instead.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY RAW - no calApplyGeomComp(), and Corr does nothing here, same
 * choice PRIME makes and for a sharper reason: the correction this rig can
 * apply is a whole-figure TRANSLATION, and a translation shifts ref 0 and
 * ref 1 EQUALLY, so it cancels in the very difference being measured. Wiring
 * comp in could not change the reading - it would only make the screen look
 * correctable when it is not. Record raw numbers here and interpret them; do
 * not try to converge this screen to zero.

 *
 * V1 registered BOTH refs at vertex 0 and drew a CAL_CROSS_ARM anchor cross
 * on top of it: the cross covered the very point being read.
 *
 * V2 added a lead-in stub outside the circle and a lead-out stub inside it,
 * both RADIAL - which put them on the SAME LINE pointing the SAME WAY, so
 * together they drew one continuous horizontal line straight THROUGH the
 * vertex. There was no distinguishable "outer tip" and "inner tip"; there was
 * a line with the polygon's corner in the middle of it, and the corner is the
 * brightest feature there. The logged session shows exactly that: A = R1 - R0
 * came out 3033/3049/2884/2708/2760/2924/2802 against a pad separation of
 * exactly 3000 - the signature of measuring ONE point against two refs, since
 * then A collapses to (ref0 - ref1). Both readings sat at ~6820 for the
 * R=6000 variants, i.e. on the vertex (ideal 6000 + the ~800 displacement),
 * not on either tip.
 *
 * V3 put the tips on OPPOSITE 45-degree corners - (+PAD, r+PAD) and
 * (-PAD, r-PAD) - which is the SAME MISTAKE ROTATED 45 DEGREES, and hardware
 * said so immediately ("for V0, the R0/1 are about the same spot"). Opposite
 * corners of one diagonal are COLLINEAR: the lead-in arrives heading
 * down-left and the lead-out departs heading down-left, so it drew one
 * straight line through the corner exactly as V2 did. "Opposite" is not the
 * same property as "not parallel", and only the second one matters here.
 *
 * V4 (this one) is a symmetric V - an arrowhead pointing inward at the
 * vertex, with BOTH arms OUTSIDE the circle, 30 degrees either side of the
 * radial axis:
 *
 *      lead-in  tip -> (+PAD_T, r + PAD_R)   upper arm, outside
 *      lead-out tip -> (-PAD_T, r + PAD_R)   lower arm, outside
 *
 * Now checked rather than eyeballed, which is how the last two versions
 * shipped broken:
 *  - NOT PARALLEL: lead-in direction (-1250,-2165), lead-out (-1250,+2165),
 *    cross product -5412500, so they cannot draw as one line.
 *  - 2500 apart in y, mirror images about the radial axis, so "upper arm" and
 *    "lower arm" are unambiguous to read.
 *  - CLEAR OF EVERY EDGE, FOR EVERY N - and this is the strong property. Both
 *    polygon edges meeting vertex 0 extend INWARD: their radial component is

 * Screen 12 - CHORD: a real closed-arc topology, reproduced exactly. The
 * question that motivated it: known starting point (x,y) -> long line to
 * new point (x1,y1) -> multipoint arc back to original starting point
 * (x,y). Why does the return arc overshoot the starting point, ending at
 * an x further to the LEFT (more negative) than the original x value?
 *
 * WHY ACCUM COULD NOT ANSWER THIS. ACCUM draws an EQUILATERAL polygon - every
 * segment the same length, so every segment takes the same dispatch path at
 * roughly the same scale. It measured that a uniform chain closes on itself
 * to within ~64 units at the model's own regime, which is far too small to
 * explain the photographed gap. The real arch is NOT uniform: it is ONE
 * VERY LONG chord (~2.6x the model's own radius, forced onto the Huge path
 * at scale ~158) followed by fifteen SHORT arc segments at a much lower
 * scale. Mixed scales inside one chained run is the difference between the
 * two figures, and it is the last untested candidate - the other three
 * have already been ruled out in the game's own renderer.
 *
 * Also independently established: the model's POINT DATA IS CORRECT. It
 * plots from source data and draws the intended shape, so the defect is
 * entirely in the drawing path - which is what this screen probes.
 *
 * THE FIGURE - a capital D, the top half of the model with the detail
 * stripped away:
 *
 *      P0 = (0, -R)   left end of the horizontal diameter   <- start AND end
 *      P1 = (0, +R)   right end
 *      chord  P0 -> P1 across the full diameter (length 2R, the LONG one)
 *      arc    P1 -> ... -> P0 over the top, N equal segments
 *
 * Same two-tip measuring trick as ACCUM (see CAL_ACCUM_PAD_T): a mirrored V
 * outside the circle at P0, so the chain's START and its ARC'S END each get an
 * isolated, unmistakable landing point and the whole-figure displacement
 * cancels in the difference.
 *
 *     A = (R=1 reading) - (R=0 reading)      <- subtract by hand, per axis
 *
 * DIRECTLY COMPARABLE WITH ACCUM: identical variant layout, identical radii,
 * identical stubs. The ONLY difference is that one edge is the long chord
 * instead of another equal arc segment. So:
 *
 *     CHORD's A  ~=  ACCUM's A   -> the long segment is innocent; the mixed
 *                                   scale hypothesis is dead too, and the
 *                                   defect is somewhere else again
 *     CHORD's A  >>  ACCUM's A   -> FOUND IT. A long segment chained among
 *                                   short ones is the mechanism, and the fix
 *                                   belongs in the dispatcher's scale handling
 *                                   (NOT in more recenters)
 *
 * EXPECTED SIGN, so the reading can be checked against the report: the arc
 * should end further LEFT (more negative x) than it started, i.e. A_dx
 * NEGATIVE. If it comes out positive on this unit, say so - that is a real
 * difference from the reporting machine, not a mistake.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY RAW - Corr does nothing here, same reasoning as ACCUM: the
 * rig's correction is a whole-figure translation, and a translation shifts
 * both tips equally, so it cancels in the very difference being measured.
