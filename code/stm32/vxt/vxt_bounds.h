/*
 * vxt_bounds.h - VXT toolkit: optional screen-boundary behavior helper.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * NOT part of vxt_scene/vxt_smart - this is a small, optional convenience
 * for game logic that moves objects around the screen. The compositor has
 * no concept of velocity or "off-screen"; it only draws whatever positions
 * you give it. This module answers ONE question - "what happens when a
 * moving object crosses the screen edge" - so every game doesn't have to
 * re-derive the same four boundary checks by hand.
 *
 * Screen extents used here are the confirmed values (Chapter 4 sec.4.0.1):
 * X: +-13500, Y: +-18000, phys units, origin at screen center, +Y=up.
