/*
 * vxt_sound.h - VXT toolkit: AY-3-8912 sound emitter (STM32 side). GPLv3.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * STM32 computes, 6809 services, via the
 * BIOS primitive Sound_Byte (WRREG, $F256) - not raw VIA writes.
 *
 * Mirrors code/app6809/vxt/vxt_sound.asm's block layout. KEEP THE TWO IN STEP.
 *
 * BLOCK (STM32 -> 6809, in the SERVED IMAGE - not parmRam, which is
 * 6809-write-only):
 *
 *   $1000:  seq                 sequence number; changes only when the command
 *                               list changes. The 6809 skips servicing entirely
 *                               when it matches its shadow (~12 cycles).
 *   $1001+: reg, val            reg = $00..$0D
 *           ...
 *           $FF                 terminator in the register-number slot
 *
 * REGISTER NUMBERING IS DECIMAL HERE. The AY-3-8910/8912 datasheet numbers its
 * registers in OCTAL: its "R10/R11/R12" (amplitude) are decimal 8/9/10, and its
 * "R13/R14/R15" (envelope) are decimal 11/12/13. Reading the datasheet's effect
 * charts literally will write amplitude values into envelope registers.
 *
 * WHY REGISTER COMMANDS AND NOT SAMPLES: badapple.asm's `doaudio`
 * is NOT a PSG example - it writes VIA_port_b = $06, which leaves BC1 (bit 3)
 * and BDIR (bit 4) both LOW, i.e. the PSG bus inactive (confirmed against
 * vecx.c's snd_update(): via_orb & 0x18 == 0 is "sound chip is disabled").
 * $06 selects mux channel 3, the analog audio line - it is streaming PCM
 * through the DAC. That is why it needs servicing after nearly every drawn line
 * and why it sounds rough: each sample's timing is hostage to the draw loop.
 * The AY's registers, by contrast, are LATCHED - "once programmed, generate and
 * sustain the sounds, thus freeing the system processor for other tasks"
 * (AY-3-8910/8912 datasheet, sec.2). One write, then nothing.

/* TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE AY FROM AN UNKNOWN PRIOR STATE.
 *
 * WHEN TO CALL IT: once, on the first frame an application starts producing
 * sound, before starting any music or effect. The AY is a latching device and
 * nothing resets it between programs, so on entry its registers hold whatever
 * the previously running code left there - a tone period and a live amplitude
 * from a title tune, a noise period, an envelope shape, an arbitrary mixer
 * routing. A music player only writes a channel when that channel has an event
 * to fire, so a stale amplitude on a channel whose first event is some frames
 * away stays audible until then. That is heard as a scratch, a buzz or a held
 * tone over the opening of the first piece of audio, and it disappears on a
 * second attempt because by then the registers have been overwritten.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: disables every tone and noise routing, parks the noise
 * generator, and writes a known period and a zero amplitude to all three
 * channels, leaving the device silent and fully specified.
 *
 * THE ONE CONSTRAINT, and it is easy to miss: this call costs 11 register pairs
 * of the VXT_SND_MAX_PAIRS (14) available in a frame. IT MUST THEREFORE BE THE
 * ONLY SOUND WORK IN ITS FRAME. Starting a three-channel song in the same frame
 * exceeds the budget and the surplus writes are discarded silently. Reset on one
 * frame and start the audio on the next.
 *
 * Do NOT call it per frame, and do not call it to stop sound mid-program -
 * vxtSoundSilence() is the cheaper way to go quiet while keeping the routing
 * intact. This is initialisation, not a volume control. */
