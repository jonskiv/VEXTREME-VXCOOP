/*
 * vxt_input.h - VXT toolkit: controller input block (STM32 side). GPLv3.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * Mirrors code/app6809/vxt/vxt_input.asm's parmRam block. KEEP THE TWO IN STEP.
 *
 * The 6809 reports RAW controller state every frame; all game logic lives here
 * on the STM32 (the VOOM model). Joystick axes are reported as SIGNED bytes,
 * verbatim from the BIOS, NOT pre-digitized into direction flags - so the same
 * block serves both digital and analog games:
 *
 *   Digital game: the 6809 fills the axes via Joy_Digital (JOYBIT, $F1F8);
 *                 just test the sign here (vxtInJoyDir()).
 *   Analog  game: the 6809 fills them via Joy_Analog (JOYSTK, $F1F5) instead -
 *                 a one-token change on that side - and the magnitude is
 *                 meaningful here. Nothing in this header changes.
 *
 * Vol. 2 confirms the two BIOS routines are drop-in interchangeable: same entry
 * values, same result locations; JOYSTK even calls JOYBIT internally.
 *
 * parmRam is 6809-WRITE-ONLY - the 6809 cannot read these back,
 * and the STM32 must never try to signal the 6809 through them. STM32->6809
 * data goes in the served image (see vxt_frame.h).
