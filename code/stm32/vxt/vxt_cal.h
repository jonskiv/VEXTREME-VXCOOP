/*
 * vxt_cal.h - VXT toolkit: CALIBRATION / MEASUREMENT RIG (STM32 side).
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * Toolkit-level, NOT game-level: this serves every game built on the VXT
 * toolkit, which is why it is a standalone 6809 cart
 * (code/app6809/test8_cal/) rather than a mode inside any one game.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT ONLY. There are deliberately no adjustable calibration
 * values, no persistence, and no settings UI in this file. A slider added
 * before the measurement exists would happily null out a defect that is
 * actually in a firmware constant, on one specific machine, permanently -
 * and the screen could not tell you which you had. Measure first, adjust
 * only from a written-down number.
 *
 * HOW A MEASUREMENT IS TAKEN. The STM32 cannot see the screen; only the user
 * can. So every screen draws (a) a test figure via some draw path and (b) an
 * independently repositioned REFERENCE MARK at the figure's ideal endpoint.
 * The gap between them is the error. The joystick drives a MEASURING CARET
 * which the user parks on where the beam visibly landed; the readout then
 * prints the caret's offset from that screen's nominal target in physical
 * units. Subjective "that looks off" becomes a number you can write down,
 * photograph, and argue about later.
