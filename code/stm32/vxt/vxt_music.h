/*
 * vxt_music.h - VXT toolkit: 3-channel song player (STM32 side). GPLv3.
 * Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
 *
 * STM32-side ONLY, built on top of vxt_sound.h - same "reusable layer over
 * a lower primitive" relationship gamelib_beam.h has to vxt_smart.h, just
 * for sound instead of graphics.
 *
 * DATA SOURCE: songs are NOT authored here. They're converted offline from
 * Vectrex Studio's MIDI-import .vpy export (tools/vpy_to_music.py) into a
 * generated {frameDelta, period, amp} event array per channel - see that
 * script's own header for the full rationale (why offline, why this
 * format, the AY period formula). This module only PLAYS that data; it has
 * no knowledge of ticks, MIDI notes, or JSON.
 *
 * WHY ONE EVENT LIST PER CHANNEL, DELTA-ENCODED: matches the AY's own
 * shape (3 independent monophonic oscillators) and keeps playback O(1) per
 * channel per frame - each channel just holds "frames remaining until my
 * next event" and decrements it, no per-frame search. Checked directly
 * against the real .vpy exports before choosing this: falcon/Leia/Rey are
 * already near-perfectly monophonic per channel (3 conflicting notes out
 * of 723 in the worst case), so one active note per channel is a real
 * match to the source data, not a lossy simplification forced on it.
 *
 * MUST SHARE ONE vxtSoundBegin()/vxtSoundEnd() SPAN PER FRAME WITH EVERY
 * OTHER vxtSound* CALLER. vxtSoundBegin() resets the pending-pairs buffer;
 * calling it a second time in the same frame silently discards whatever
 * the first caller queued (confirmed against vxt_sound.c - vs_count is
 * just reset to 0, and vxtSoundEnd() writes into the same served-image
 * bytes each time, so only the LAST Begin/End pair in a frame survives).
 * vxtMusicUpdate() below does NOT call vxtSoundBegin()/vxtSoundEnd()
 * itself for exactly this reason - the caller must already be inside an
 * open span (see the game's own sound-update function, which wraps this
 * and its explosion-sound update together).

 * vm_need_start_init - the SAME "reclaim the whole mixer: all 3 tones on,
 * no noise" flag whose loop-restart case was fixed in a later round.
 * That fix only covered a song looping into ITSELF; switching to a
 * DIFFERENT song still went through vxtMusicPlay() and re-armed the flag,
 * so a saucer spawning/dying mid-explosion (very common - saucers die FROM
 * a hit, which is exactly when the explosion noise burst is active) still
 * stomped channel B's noise routing back to tone-only. Use this instead of
 * vxtMusicPlay() for a mid-gameplay switch to a DIFFERENT song while combat
 * SFX may be active: same per-channel timeline reset as a loop-restart,
 * but leaves vm_need_start_init (and therefore the mixer/silence reclaim)
 * alone, so an in-progress explosion/laser/coin channel-borrow survives
 * the switch untouched. Reserve plain vxtMusicPlay() for a song starting
