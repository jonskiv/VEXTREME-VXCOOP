; test8_cal.asm - 6809 side of the VXT CALIBRATION RIG.
; Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
;
; A STANDALONE TOOLKIT APP, deliberately not a mode inside any one game:
; calibration serves every game built on this toolkit, so the measurement
; rig is its own cart.
;
; This file follows the same proven structure any toolkit game cart uses -
; address-publish handshake, Wait_Recal/read-input/RPC/vxt_smart frame
; loop, analog-joystick setup. That is deliberate: the STM32 side is
; where all the rig's intelligence lives (vxt/vxt_cal.c), and this file
; should stay a dumb executor that never needs editing again.
;
; CONVENTIONS THIS FILE EXISTS TO RESPECT (both came from
; a real board freeze, do not "tidy" either away):
;   1. Explicit `jmp main` immediately after the cartridge header. Do NOT
;      rely on fall-through.
;   2. The RAM-resident RPC stub is included PHYSICALLY LAST, past every
;      branch target - mid-STM32-computation the normal ROM bytes are not
;      served, so 6809 code still fetching from "ROM" can crash.
;
; Uses Joy_Analog (not Joy_Digital) because the rig's measuring caret needs
; proportional stick response - Joy_Digital only ever reports -1/0/1,
; which cannot position a caret finely enough to read
; an error off in physical units.
