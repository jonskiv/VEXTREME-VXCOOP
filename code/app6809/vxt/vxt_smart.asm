; vxt_smart.asm - VXT toolkit: SmartList draw engine (6809 side)
; Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
;
; Based on the technique Malban documents in "VPatrol ingenuity part III"
; (vide.malban.de, 6 Feb 2018), attributed there to Kristof. Malban's measured
; numbers on the same 60-vector glider:
;       Draw_VL_Mode  7803 cycles   (~130/vector)
;       Draw_VLp      4825 cycles   (~80/vector)
;       drawSmart     2122 cycles   (~35/vector)   <-- this technique
; Our vxt_draw.asm costs ~77-98 cycles/record, so this is a ~2.2x win.
;
; HOW IT WORKS. The list is a string of (A, B, subroutine-address) triples.
; Every routine ends with `pulu a,b,pc`, which loads the NEXT record's A and B
; and jumps to the NEXT record's routine in one instruction - Malban: "for the
; cost of mere 9 cycles". That single instruction replaces vxt_draw's entire
; ~33-cycle interpretive dispatch (lda ,x+ / cmpa #$ff / bita / tsta / cmpa
; cache / branches). Same 4 bytes per record we already use.
;
; LIST FORMAT (4 bytes/record, U points at it):
;       db  y, x            ; -> A, B
;       dw  SM_<routine>    ; -> PC
; Terminate with:
;       db  0, 0
;       dw  SM_end
;
; TWO FURTHER TRICKS, both from the post:
;   * The shift register is NOT touched between vectors, so consecutive draws
;     (or moves) chain without re-blanking - "the subroutine can be used for a
;     'continued' move or a 'continued' draw".
;   * NO SPIN-WAIT LOOPS. "Within all SmartList functions there is not one Wait
;     loop or interrupt flag interrogating - the timer is ALWAYS expired before
;     the next relevant changes are made." vxt_draw's `bitb VIA_int_flags/beq`
;     loop disappears entirely.
;
; *** TIMING - READ THIS ***
; Malban: the routines work out of the box "up to a scale of 9 (perhaps 10).
; Above that scale the routines have timing issues", because Timer 1 must be
; allowed to expire before anything new is done. His fix is to insert nops
; after each `clr <VIA_t1_cnt_hi`:
;       nop (SPRITE_SCALE-9)/2
; VXT_SM_SCALE below drives the ADD_NOPS macro to do exactly that. If lines
; come out short or partly drawn, the scale is outrunning the nop padding -
; raise VXT_SM_SCALE (which adds nops) or lower the scale.
;
; HONEST NOTE ON PROVENANCE: the post shows SM_setScale in full, but the
; move/draw routine bodies are images that did not survive the PDF text
; extraction. The routines below are reconstructed from vxt_draw.asm's own
; (hardware-proven) VIA sequence, restructured into the pulu-dispatch shape.
; The dispatch mechanism and the no-wait/shift-register tricks are Malban's
; and are quoted above; the exact instruction bodies are ours and WILL need
; hardware iteration. vxt_draw.asm is untouched and remains the fallback.
;
; ENTRY: U = list base. Requires DP=$D0 and `setdp #$d0`.
; DESTROYS: A, B, U, and PC obviously. X is preserved.

                                        ; (0x0C = 12 decimal)

; Malban's ADD_NOPS: pad so Timer 1 has expired before the next change.
; `nop (VXT_SM_SCALE-9)/2` is invalid syntax - the 6809's
; NOP takes NO operand at all (it's not like x86 REP-prefixed instructions);
; there is no "repeat count" form. asm6809 has no REPT/repeat-block directive
; used anywhere else in this project either, so rather than guess at one,
; this emits the LITERAL nop count computed for our actual VXT_SM_SCALE:
;     (12 - 9) / 2 = 1     (integer division, truncated)
; If VXT_SM_SCALE changes, recompute (SCALE-9)/2 and adjust the nop count
; below by hand - this is a fixed constant, not a live macro parameter.

; padding is computed ONCE, at assembly time, for VXT_SM_SCALE - it
; has no way to know what scale is actually loaded when a routine runs. Row
; repositioning (vxtSmartMoveBig, STM32 side) sets scale to POS_SCALE (32) but
; was dispatching through the SAME 1-nop-padded SM_startMove_d used for
; scale-12 box edges - Timer 1 had not expired before the next VIA write, the
; exact "drift madness" Malban's post warns about for under-padded high-scale
; operations. Malban's own formula, (SCALE-9)/2, gives 11 nops for scale 32 -
; and his post's own worked high-scale example uses this EXACT scale ($20),
; so this isn't extrapolated, it's his own tested value.
;
; Used ONLY by vxtSmartMoveBig() (STM32 side) for row/position repositioning.
; Box edges continue through SM_startMove_d/SM_continue_d at scale 12, which
; were already correctly padded and are unaffected by this fix.

; SM_startDrawBig_d - identical to SM_startDraw_d, but padded for scale $40
; (64), not the project's default scale $0C (12). Added when a caller
; needed long draws in ONE record with NO chaining at all - grid lines up
; to 6400 phys units, and a scale-32 version of this routine (first
; attempt) still needed 2 chained records (3200 each), leaving a visible
; mid-line joint that measurably affected the projected geometry once
; yaw/pitch rotation was applied. At scale 64, a rate of +-100 (this
; project's established chaining safety margin) covers +-6400 phys units
; in ONE record, zero joints.
;
; *** UNVERIFIED ON REAL HARDWARE AS OF THIS WRITING - READ BEFORE TRUSTING ***
; The scale-32/11-nop pairing this routine originally used (still used by
; SM_startMoveBig_d) IS hardware-proven. This scale-64/27-nop pairing is NOT
; - it is Malban's own formula, (SCALE-9)/2, applied one step further than
; this project has ever gone (12 -> 32 -> 64), not a value anyone has
; confirmed on real Vectrex hardware yet. If lines still come out short,
; wavy, or misplaced at this scale, the formula itself may not extrapolate
; cleanly this far - do not assume linearity holds without seeing it draw
; correctly first.
;
; Used ONLY by vxtSmartDrawBig() (STM32 side). Chains by repeating THIS
; routine for each step (never a separate "continue" variant) - mirroring
; vxtSmartMoveBig's own exact chaining pattern (vxt_smart.c: `while
; (ry!=0||rx!=0) sm_rec(sy,sx,sm_addrs.startMoveBig)`), since re-asserting
; VIA_shift_reg=$FF when it's already $FF is a harmless no-op. Existing
; scale-12 SM_startDraw_d/SM_continue_d and scale-32 SM_startMoveBig_d are
; UNCHANGED and remain correct for their own uses - this is a new, additive
; routine, not a replacement.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; SM_startDraw32_d - DRAW at scale $20 (32).
;
; The missing third draw scale. Until now draws existed only at 12
; (SM_startDraw_d, 1 nop) and 64 (SM_startDrawBig_d, 27 nops); scale 32 had
; a MOVE routine (SM_startMoveBig_d) but no draw counterpart.
;
; WHY IT IS NEEDED. SM_startDrawBig_d costs 97 6809 cycles, 52 of which are
; its 27 NOPs waiting out the scale-64 beam ramp - and Timer 1 counts down
; from the SCALE, not from the line's length, so a short edge at scale 64
; burns the full scale-64 wait for nothing. Dropping short edges to scale 12
; was tried first and was much faster but produced TWO real hardware
; defects, both traceable to the scale itself:
;
;   1. CONVERGENCE. A draw lands on a multiple of its own scale, and
;      repositions land on multiples of the reposition grid's scale (32).
;      64 = 2*32 so
;      scale-64 landings sit on the reposition grid; 12 shares only a factor
;      of 4 with 32, so the two grids coincide just every 96 units. Vertices
;      reached by a short edge and by a reposition disagreed by up to ~22
;      units (~1.2px) - reported as "two separate dots" where mesh and hull
;      lines should meet. Scale 32 IS the reposition grid, so this term
;      vanishes by construction.
;   2. BRIGHTNESS. Dwell time is proportional to scale, so scale 12 is 5.3x
;      dimmer than 64 at any length - reported as a meter hash "not a
;      complete line". Scale 32 is 2x, not 5.3x.
;
; Cost: 12 nops, Malban's own (SCALE-9)/2 for scale 32 - the SAME count
; SM_startMoveBig_d already uses and which is hardware-proven at this
; scale, so the padding is not an extrapolation here (unlike
; SM_startDrawBig_d's 27, which is still flagged unverified in its own
; header). ~67 cycles vs 97: a 30-cycle saving per short edge with no
; grid or brightness regression.
;
; Identical to SM_startMoveBig_d except for the shift-register write that
; turns the beam ON - exactly the relationship SM_startDraw_d has to
; SM_startMove_d. Additive: every existing routine is untouched.

; (`ldb #$40 / wait: bitb VIA_int_flags / beq wait`), correct for ANY scale
; loaded into VIA_t1_cnt_lo, not just one pre-verified at assembly time.
;
; The scale-64/27-nop pairing above was flagged UNVERIFIED when written and
; never independently hardware-tested; any long-line draw depending on it
; (grid lines, complex models with many long edges) inherits that risk,
; worst on the models with the longest, most-chained edges. A model's
; longest edges need many chained BigScale steps (worse the closer it gets,
; since projected edge length grows toward the eye), each one a fresh
; dispatch through that unverified timing. This routine exists so the
; STM32 side can pick whatever scale actually minimizes chained steps for
; a given edge (see gamelibDrawHugeLine(), gamelib_beam.c) WITHOUT needing
; a matching hand-verified nop count for every scale it might choose - the
; poll is correct regardless.
;
; Cost: real, and paid on every use - `vxt_draw.asm`'s own header measured
; this same technique at ~2.2x a SmartList dispatch's cost. Deliberately
; scoped to ONLY this one routine, used ONLY where a caller explicitly opts
; into it (gamelibDrawHugeLine()) - every other SmartList path (small-scale
; chaining, the proven scale-32 MoveBig, and the still-unverified-but-

; SM_setScaleHi / SM_startDrawHuge16_d - widen the ramp DURATION itself past
; the 8-bit ceiling every routine above has always had, by using Timer 1's
; REAL 16-bit range instead of discarding its high byte.
;
; Answers the question "why can't one record just draw the whole line, the
; Vectrex can do that natively?" - it CAN. VIA_t1_cnt_hi ($D005) is the high byte
; of a genuine 16-bit down-counter (standard 6522 VIA Timer 1) - but every
; single existing routine in this file AND vxt_draw.asm unconditionally does
; `clr <VIA_t1_cnt_hi` when starting a ramp, discarding 248 of the 256
; possible high-byte values and capping every ramp's real duration (hence
; reach, since distance = coordinate-byte x duration) at whatever fits in the
; LOW byte alone (max 255). That 8-bit ceiling was never a Vectrex hardware
; limit - it's this project's own record format only ever having carried an
; 8-bit "scale" byte, inherited faithfully from VOOM's original design (which
; likely never needed more, since its per-segment adaptive scale keeps
; individual segments short). Loading a REAL high byte instead of hardcoding
; zero raises the max single-record reach from ~25,500 phys units (100*255)
; to ~6,553,500 (100*65535) - comfortably past any realistic single edge
; a game built on this toolkit is likely to draw, near-plane distortion
; included. No chaining needed at that point.
;
; The high byte can't be pre-loaded into VIA_t1_cnt_hi directly - writing it
; is what TRANSFERS the latched low byte + this high byte into the real
; counter and STARTS the ramp (standard 6522 semantics), so it must be
; staged somewhere else first and loaded from there at the moment the ramp
; actually starts. VXT_SM_SCALE_HI (Vectrex work RAM, NOT the VIA register)
; is that staging byte - outside the $D0xx direct page this file otherwise
; uses, same precedent as vxt_draw.asm's VXT_DRAW_LAST_I (also outside DP,
; accessed via plain extended addressing, no `<` prefix).
;
; Additive, not a replacement: SM_startDrawHuge_d above is untouched and
; stays the path for anything that already fits in 8 bits (the common,
; hardware-confirmed case) - gamelibDrawHugeLine() only escalates to
; this 16-bit path when the needed scale actually exceeds 255. Still a
; genuine Timer 1 poll, not nop-padding - correct at any 16-bit duration with
; no calibration, for the same reason SM_startDrawHuge_d needed none.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Hardcoded to $C8A2 (= vxt_sound.asm's VXT_VARS_BASE+2), NOT referenced
; symbolically - same reason vxt_draw.asm's VXT_DRAW_LAST_I is hardcoded to
; $C8A1: apps that don't include vxt_sound.asm at all would fail to
; assemble against a symbol that doesn't exist. vxt_sound.asm's own

; changed. This a) saves cycles b) the subroutine can be used for a 'continued'
; move or a 'continued' draw."
