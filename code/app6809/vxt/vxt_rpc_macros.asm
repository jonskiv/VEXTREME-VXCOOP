; vxt_rpc_macros.asm - VXT toolkit: RPC equates and macros ONLY (6809 side)
; Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
;
; Split out from the original vxt_rpc.asm specifically so this file
; contains NO real instruction bytes - only equates and macro/template
; definitions, which asm6809 does not emit until invoked. This makes it
; safe to include immediately after a cartridge header, before `main`,
; without risking the power-on fall-through hazard that froze real
; hardware early in this toolkit's development. The RAM-only stub body
; itself now lives in the companion file vxt_rpc_stub.asm, which MUST be
; included last in any application - defense in depth alongside an
; explicit `jmp main` after the header.
;
; USAGE (from an application main.asm):
;     include "vectrex.i"
;     org 0
;     [cartridge header]
;     jmp main
;     setdp #$d0                       ; assembler directive - see note below
;     include "../vxt/vxt_rpc_macros.asm"
;     include "../vxt/vxt_draw.asm"     ; or other toolkit modules, as needed
;   main
;     VXT_RPC_INIT                     ; copies stub to RAM, sets runtime DP
;     ...
;     VXT_RPC #66
;     ...
;     include "../vxt/vxt_rpc_stub.asm" ; MUST be last in the file
;
; NOTE ON setdp: `setdp #$d0` is a pure assembler directive (no emitted
; bytes) telling asm6809 to assume DP=$D0 when choosing between direct-page
; (2-byte) and extended (3-byte) addressing for subsequent source lines -
; confirmed by cross-checking VOOM's identical use of it. It is a
; compile-time, source-POSITION-dependent effect, distinct from the runtime
; `lda #$d0 / tfr a,dp` instructions (in VXT_RPC_INIT below) that set the
; CPU's actual DP register at execution time. Both are required; place the
; `setdp` directive early in the file (before any VIA-register-touching
; code you want assembled compactly), regardless of where VXT_RPC_INIT is
; actually invoked at runtime.
