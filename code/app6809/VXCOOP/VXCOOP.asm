; VXCOOP.asm - VX-COOP: VXT toolkit reference application, 6809 side.
; Copyright (C) 2026 Caelotronics.
;
; This file is the complete 6809 half of a cooperative dual-CPU application,
; and it consists of approximately sixty instructions. The division of labor
; is the reason: the STM32 owns all application state, geometry, arithmetic,
; sound composition and persistence, while the 6809 reports the controller,
; requests a frame, services the PSG, and draws. No code in this file knows
; what is being drawn.
;
; Read alongside docs/VX-COOP/VX-COOP_Reference_Guide.md, which derives every
; mechanism used here, and code/stm32/vxt/vxcoop_handler.c, the STM32 side
; this file drives.
;
; FILE ORDERING IS SIGNIFICANT. Both of the following defences were adopted
; after a power-on failure on real hardware:
;
;   1. An explicit `jmp main` immediately after the cartridge header. The
;      Vectrex BIOS convention is to fall through to whatever follows the
;      header's terminating zero byte, so without this jump execution enters
;      whatever the assembler placed next.
;   2. The RAM-resident RPC stub include placed physically last, after every
;      loop and branch target. vxt_rpc_stub.asm contains assembled instruction
;      bytes intended only to be copied into RAM and executed there. When that
;      include was placed immediately after the header, the 6809 executed the
;      stub in place at power-on with undefined values in A and X, stored an
;      undefined RPC identifier to $7FFF, and then executed `jmp ,x` to an
;      undefined address.
;
; Retain both. Sprite_tm's 2015 VOOM source already used the second
; structurally; the first was added independently.
;
; A macros-only include (vxt_rpc_macros.asm) may safely be placed early,
; because it emits no bytes until a macro is invoked. Only the stub body must
; be placed last.

; an empty title silently disables per-cartridge score persistence.

; THE ADDRESS HANDSHAKE. One-shot, and the mechanism by which the STM32 is able
; to emit code addresses it cannot know at compile time.
;
; A SmartList record has the form (A, B, subroutine-address): the 6809's
; `pulu a,b,pc` loads the next record's two data bytes and jumps to its routine
; in a single instruction. The STM32 must therefore write genuine 6809
; addresses into the list, but those routines are located wherever this
; cartridge's assembler placed them. The cartridge consequently publishes them
; into parmRam once at startup, and the STM32 caches the resulting table.
;
; The order and offsets below must match the vxtSmartAddrs structure unpacked
; by vxt_smart_addrs_handler() on RPC 69. Emitting records before the table is
; populated is a no-op, which fails as a blank screen rather than by jumping
; the 6809 to an arbitrary address.
;
; An application may publish a subset. Routines it never uses may be omitted,
; and the emitter functions requiring them are simply never called. The single
; exception is startDraw32, which the dispatcher rather than the application
; elects to use; vxtSmartHasDraw32() range-checks it before any record is
; emitted through it.
